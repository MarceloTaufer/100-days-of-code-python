# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 25, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Today was back to basics. I reviewed print and input statements, manipulations of strings and variable assignments.\
I have created a program generating a band name from user inputs.

**Thoughts:** Easy topics but good to start up on this exciting journey.

### Day 2: February 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Still digging in the basics. Today I reviewed the major data types (str, int, float, bool), mathematical operators, rounding, formatting and F-String.

**Thoughts** I enjoyed going through the material and building the tip calculator app. It is accessible from my cellphone so very handy in real life when it is time to split the bill!
