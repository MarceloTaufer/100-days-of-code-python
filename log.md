# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 25, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Today was back to basics. I reviewed print and input statements, manipulations of strings and variable assignments.\
I have created a program generating a band name with inputs from the user.

**Thoughts:** Easy topics but good to start up on this exciting journey.
