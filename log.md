# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 25, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Today was back to basics. I reviewed print and input statements, manipulations of strings and variable assignments.\
I have created a program generating a band name from user inputs.

**Thoughts:** Easy topics but good to start up on this exciting journey.

### Day 2: February 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Still digging in the basics. Today I reviewed the major data types (str, int, float, bool), mathematical operators, rounding, formatting and F-String.

**Thoughts** I enjoyed going through the material and building the tip calculator app. It is accessible from my cellphone so very handy in real life when it is time to split the bill!

### Day 3: February 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed conditional statements, comparison and logical operators, code block and scope.

**Thoughts** It was interesting to use nested if/elif/else statements, multiple if statements. I had fun building the love_calculator and treasure_island games. Good revision of functions like lower() and count() and how to include ASCII art with print('''     '''').

### Day 4: February 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on randomization and python lists. I reviewed the random module and some of its functions (random(), randint(), choice(),...) and used lists and nested lists.

**Thoughts** Great content and I am happy to have built a Rock Paper Scissors game to play against the computer.

### Day 5: March 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed the For loop, the range function, and code blocks.

**Thoughts** I built a very useful password generator using list comprehension, random.shuffle(*list*), and ''.join(*list*).

### Day 6: March 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I covered Python functions, code blocks and the While loop.

**Thoughts** I really enjoy the Reeborg Maze debugging cases. This was challenging.

### Day 7: March 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I have built a hangman game with Python.

**Thoughts** The game is fun and allowed me to go over modules, loops, conditional and math operators, and list comprehension.

### Day 8: March 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed python functions with inputs.

**Thoughts** I have built a great Caesar Cipher app to encode and decode meassages.

### Day 9: March 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed Python dictionaries and nesting.

**Thoughts** I have built an auction program.

### Day 11: March 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: First capstone project in this program. 

**Thoughts** I built a Blackjack game with python.

### Day 12: March 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed Python Local vs Global Scope.\
I also completed a machine learning project where I used TensorFlow Neural Networks for Image Classification.

**Thoughts** Interesting topic about python namescapes. Used local and global variables in the functions used to build the Mystery Number game.\
It was a few weeks since I worked on a datascience project so I really enjoyed going over the image classifier project.
